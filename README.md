Alex
As a hunter in a new area.  
I want a new long range rifle, 
so that I can make the long range shots 
required of my new setup.

Beth
As an experienced bow hunter.
I want to get new broadheads,
so that I can make clean more ethical kills.

Sam
As an intermediate hunter for 10 years. 
I want to get a better shotgun so that 
I can trust the reliabilty of the firearm.
